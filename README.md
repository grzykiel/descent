# Descent
A Downwell-like game for the Arduboy console.

## Gameplay
Fall down an endless shaft. Shoot blocks. Blast and stomp enemies. Collect upgrades and gain powerups through combos.

## Controls
For a standard Arduboy, the game is designed for the console to be oriented 90 degrees anti-clockwise.
This means the D-PAD is rotated relative to player movement.
* UP and DOWN: move left and right
* A, B, LEFT, and RIGHT: jump or shoot

If building for a homebrew console with a display that is physically rotated relative to the D-PAD, uncomment `#define ROTATE_DPAD` in controls.h
